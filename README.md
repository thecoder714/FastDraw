**Note:** Quick Draw is a game created by Google where you have 20 seconds to draw a sketch chosen by the computer. FastDraw is a recreation of Google's Quick Draw.

## How to play: 
Go to the website: https://thecoder714.github.io/FastDraw/
Upon opening the website, within a few seconds FastDraw will generate a sketch for you.

After that, you need to draw the given sketch (in this case it is "The Mona Lisa"), on the white canvas below within 60 seconds. If you draw it correctly, it will try to recognise what sketch you have drawn. If you drew the correct sketch, your score will be incremented by 1.
